Need to have add, subtract, mulitply and divide functions. 

/home/jodin22sams/repos/javascript-exercises/08_calculator/calculator.js.

Reference the 08_calculator hw since those have add, subtract and multiply functions. Divide will be a new function. You will also 
need an operate function that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

*/

/*  
Pseudocode: For the first two numbers; initialNumber and nextNumber. They will enter initialNumber, then press either add, 
subtract, multiply or divide. Then they will enter the nextNumber. Whichever operator they pressed, send the iniitalNumber and 
nextNumber to that function. Store the answer. 

If subtract is pressed, then then send initialNumber and nextNumber to the subtract function. Store the answer. 

If multiply is pressed, then then send initialNumber and nextNumber to the multiply function. Store the answer. 

If divide is pressed, then then send initialNumber and nextNumber to the divide function. Store the answer. 

If equal is pressed, then show the answer. If equal is not pressed and they enter another number, then take the stored answer 
from the first two numbers and send that answer with the new number to whichever function they want (add, sub, mult or div). 

Keep doing the above until equal is pressed. The equal button will stop everything and show an answer.
*/

/*  
Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an 
operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key.
You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, update the display with 
the ‘solution’ to the operation.

This is the hardest part of the project. You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with
them. Don’t feel bad if it takes you a while to figure out the logic.

*/

/*
Gotchas: watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:
Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated
at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42. An example of the behavior we’re looking for would be this student 
solution.

Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), 
followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should
then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), 
and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).

// get two numbers. put the first number in initialNumber. the second one is put in nextNumber. if they press add or subtract, 
// then the addOperator() or subtractOperator() will do its job and send the results to initialAnswer. if they put another number, 
// then this new number updates nextNumber. if they press add or subtract again, then it will send the new number along with
// initialAnswer to the addOperator() or subtractOperator() and update initialAnswer. this keeps going until they press equals.

instead of treating them as numbers, it treats them as strings?

after you get add to work, see how to extend each operation to more than one pair of numbers. maybe a loop? bc you are 
storing the numbers in displayArray[], maybe advance the i and i+1 a little each time. so each odd is the first number and 
each even is the second number of a future pair. then try to do the operations on multiple pairs.
